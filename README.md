#Overview
In this project, an insight report on the analysis of the global temperature trend in comparison with the local temperature trend of where I live will be carried out. The data which will be used was measured by scientist all around the world through the combined measurement of the temperature of the air above land and the ocean surface of the earth.


#Introduction 
Lagos city in Nigeria is where I live. Lagos is the most populous city in Nigeria and the major financial center for all of Africa. Lagos experiences a tropical savanna climate as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season. The average temperature trend of this beautiful city will be compared to the global average temperature trend.
